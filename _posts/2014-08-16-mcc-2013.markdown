<>**What is MCC?**The Malaysian Computing Competition (MCC) is a paper-based contest that is used as a preliminary selection round for the International Olympiad in Informatics (IOI). The MCC was founded in 2012 to fill the need for a programming contest for Malaysian high schools students.Malaysia first participated in the IOI 2011 (Thailand) as an invited observer, before sending full teams to IOI 2012 (Italy) and IOI 2013 (Australia). MCC 2013 is the preliminary selection round for the Malaysian team to the IOI 2014 that will be held in Taiwan:[![ioi2014](http://ioimalaysia.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/ioi2014.jpg)](http://ioimalaysia.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/ioi2014.jpg)IOI is the most prestigious high school programming competitions in the world. It is organized under the patronage of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO). IOI is the fourth oldest among the Science Olympiads for high school students. Even though the competition is among high school students, the standard is extremely high and the problems in the IOI would challenge even the top professional programmers.Official website of IOI: [http://www.ioinformatics.org/index.shtml](http://www.ioinformatics.org/index.shtml).<>**Objectives**The objectives of MCC are:- to promote computing education among secondary and pre-university students in Malaysia

A seminar will be held at KICT, IIUM, tentatively in December 2013 to explain about the MCO in more details to the invited participants.The top scorers in MCO will be called for a series of intensive training camps conducted by former IOI participants. Students who qualify at this level will participate in Asia Pacific Informatics Olympiad (APIO), an annual online contest among countries in the Pacific Rim region.Official website of APIO: [http://www.apio.olympiad.org/](http://www.apio.olympiad.org/).[![ioilogo](http://ioimalaysia.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/ioilogo-300x170.png)](http://ioimalaysia.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/ioilogo.png)After the training camps and APIO, the best four students will be selected to represent Malaysia in IOI 2014 which will take place in Taiwan on 13-20 July 2014.Official website of IOI 2014: [http://www.ioi2014.org/](http://www.ioi2014.org/).The Malaysian team did well in IOI 2013, winning two Silver medals via How Si Yu and Tham Ying Hong.The Star covered the news: [Two Malaysians bag historic silver at International Olympiad in Informatics](http://www.thestar.com.my/News/Nation/2013/07/18/International-Olympiad-in-Informatics-2013.aspx).
