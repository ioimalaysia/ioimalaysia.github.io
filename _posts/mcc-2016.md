## Overview

### What is the MCC?
The MCC (Malaysian Computing Challenge) is an annual online computing competition. Participants will be required to have some basic programming knowledge in order to solve the problems.

### Organizers
MCC is brought to you by the Malaysian Informatics and Programming Society. See our [About][8] page for more details.

### Partner
[![hackerrank](/images/hackerrank.jpeg)][9]

### Beyond the MCC
The MCC is the preliminary selection process of a year-long program to identify and train the top programming talents in Malaysian schools. Top scorers in MCC will be:

1. Invited to a programming camp, tentatively to be held in December 2016\.
2. Upon successful completion of the camp, to be invited to the Malaysian Computing Olympiad (MCO), a real-time programming competition, to be held tentatively in April 2017\.
The top scorers in MCO will be called for a series of intensive training camps conducted by experienced Olympiad participants. Students who qualify at this level will participate in Asia Pacific Informatics Olympiad (APIO), an annual online contest among countries in the Pacific Rim region. After the training camps and APIO, four students will be selected to represent Malaysia in [International Olympiad in Informatics (IOI)][10] 2017 which will take place in Tehran, Iran in July 2017\.

## Dates and Venue
The MCC will take place online on 1 October 2016, from 3:00pm to 6:00pm (GMT+8), administered directly at schools. Each school is required to elect a teacher-in-charge to invigilate the competition.

## Format
This year, the MCC will be held on [HackerRank][11]. Participants will be required to solve 5-6 problems over 3 hours. Please note that this year's format is different from previous years - **participants have to submit correct programs to obtain marks**. Sample problems can be viewed on our practice site.

1. Please register for an account on HackerRank to access the practice site and the contest. **This has to be done prior to registering for the MCC.**
2. Each problem consists of some text and some sample test cases.
3. Participants are to submit a piece of working code (in any of the allowed languages) that can read the input provided by the online judge correctly and output the correct answer.
4. The code submitted will be checked against test cases. If the code passes all test cases, the participant will be awarded full marks for the problem.

## Allowed Languages
Participants may only submit programs written in one of the following programming languages during the contest.

1. Python 3 (Recommended for beginners)
2. Python 2
3. C++
4. Java

## Practice Problems
Participants can access problems from MCC 2015 as practice. We have adapted the problems so that it fits the new format.

## Beginner's Guide
Participants can access our MCC Beginner's Guide here.
[**Beginner's Guide**][12]

## Categories and Awards
There are three categories for the MCC:

1. Bongsu / Junior -- Form 1, 2, 3, or Primary school;
2. Muda / Intermediate -- Form 4, 5;
3. Sulung / Senior -- Form 6 (lower & upper), Pre-U (Matriculation, Foundation Studies, IB, A-Levels, etc.).
All students will take part in the same competition, but prizes will be awarded by category. There will be individual and team prizes. Individual prizes are Gold, Silver, Bronze and Honorable Mention awards. The best performing five students in each category will automatically be in the school's team. Teams are ranked according to the total of their individual scores. Team prizes are also Gold, Silver, Bronze and Honorable Mention awards. Please consider sending at least five students per category. This would allow your school to qualify for a team prize.
