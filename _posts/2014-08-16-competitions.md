WeÂ aim to support computing education for secondary and pre-university students in Malaysia by organizing:

1. The annual Malaysian Computing Competition (MCC), a computational-thinking contest.
2. The annual Malaysian Computing Olympiad (MCO), an algorithmic computer programming competition. Participation to the MCO is by invitation-only to the top performers in the MCC.
3. Training camps for the top programming students in Malaysia. Shortlisted students will take part in the Asia-Pacific Informatics Olympiad (APIO), a difficult algorithmic computer programming competition.
4. Opportunity for the top 4 students in Malaysia to represent their country at the International Olympiad in Informatics (IOI), the most prestigious international algorithmic computer programming competition at the secondary and pre-university level.

## Road to the IOI

The selection process for the IOI involves several stages, starting from the Malaysian Computing Competition, which is open to all Malaysian students. The best performers are then invited to undergo a series of selection tests and camps, through which the final four students are selected to represent Malaysia at the annual International Olympiad in Informatics.For the 2014 IOI season, feel free to explore the links below for details regarding the different stages of the process:-

- [MCC 2013](/mcc/mcc-2013/ "MCC 2013") was held on 18 September 2013
- [MCO 2014](/mco/mco-2014/ "MCO 2014") was held on 19-20 April 2014 at Wisma Jobstreet, KL
- [APIO 2014](/apio-2014/ "APIO 2014") was held on 4 May 2014 at Wisma Jobstreet, KL

In summary:- Malaysian Computing Competition (MCC)
- Malaysian Computing Olympiad (MCO)
- Training Camps
- Asia-Pacific Informatics Olympiad (APIO)
- International Olympiad in Informatics (IOI)
