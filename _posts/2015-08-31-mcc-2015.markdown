The MCC is the preliminary selection process of a year-long program to identify and train the top programming talents in Malaysian schools. Top scorers in MCC will be:1. Invited to a programming camp, tentatively to be held in December 2015.
2. Upon successful completion of the camp, to be invited to the Malaysian Computing Olympiad (MCO), a real-time programming competition, to be held tentatively in April 2016.
The top scorers in MCO will be called for a series of intensive training camps conducted by experienced Olympiad participants. Students who qualify at this level will participate in Asia Pacific Informatics Olympiad (APIO), an annual online contest among countries in the Pacific Rim region. After the training camps and APIO, four students will be selected to represent Malaysia in [International Olympiad in Informatics (IOI)](http://www.ioinformatics.org/) 2016 which will take place in Kazan, Russia in August 2016.## Dates and Venue

2. Each problem consists of some text and some sample test cases.
3. Participants are to submit a piece of working code (in any of the allowed languages) that can read the input provided by the online judge correctly and output the correct answer.
4. The code submitted will be checked against test cases. If the code passes all test cases, the participant will be awarded full marks for the problem.
## Allowed Languages
Participants may only submit programs written in one of the following programming languages during the contest.1. Python 3 (Recommended for beginners)
2. Python 2

3. Sulung / Senior – Form 6 (lower &amp; upper), Pre-U (Matriculation, Foundation Studies, IB, A-Levels, etc.).
All students will take part in the same competition, but prizes will be awarded by category. There will be individual and team prizes. Individual prizes are Gold, Silver, Bronze and Honorable Mention awards. The best performing five students in each category will automatically be in the school’s team.
