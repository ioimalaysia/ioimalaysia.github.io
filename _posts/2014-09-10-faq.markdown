Can I participate?**We are planning to invite a small number of participants outside Malaysia through their country's IOI establishment. For the time being, however, we do not open the contest to international students. This might change in the future.**If I participate, will I get a certificate?**Yes. Each participant will receive a certificate of participation, issued by the organizers MIPS and KICT, IIUM. Each award winners will also receive a certificate of award. The certificates will be mailed to the participating schools before the end of the Malaysian 2014 school term. For independent participants, the certs will be mailed to your home address.&nbsp;#### **CONTEST**
**Can I use the demo account I've created to log-in for the contest?**No. Each participant will be provided a log-in credential, that is unique to each registered participant.**How do I obtain the log-in credential?**The usernames and passwords will be emailed to the teachers in charge and independent participants on 23 September 2014. Please check your email thoroughly, in case it gets sent to the spam box. If you are a teacher in charge, please distribute the usernames and passwords to your participants before the contest period.**What should I do in case of technical problem during the contest period?**We will have our technical staff on standby during the contest period. You may call them directly, but we recommend calling between 9am to 6pm. Their contact numbers will be provided in the email containing the log-in credentials.**Do I need to submit my code?**No, you only need to submit your answer to the tasks.**If the answer is 2,3 will I get the correct answer if I key in 2 ,3 ****or 2 , 3 instead?**Yes. Spaces do not affect correctness of the answer. For every problem, there will be an example output format. Please take effort to follow the recommended output format in the example.**If the answer is 2,3 will I get the correct answer if I key in 2;3 or ****2.3 instead?**No. Please use comma to separate the inputs in an array.**Is it compulsory to learn Python to participate in MCC?**No. The Python interface is placed on the system for your convenience. We recommend Python since it is one of the most beginner-friendly of all the standard programming languages, and would be helpful to solve the challenging tasks. If you already know a programming language (e.g. C++ or Pascal), you can use it as well.**I do not have time to learn programming, can I still solve the ****challenging tasks?**The challenging tasks are the soul of MCC. Theoretically the challenging tasks can be solved by pencil and paper if you have extraordinary patience, but bear in mind that the objective of the contest is to introduce students to programming.**The MCO and IOI are C++ contest, why do you recommend Python for the MCC?**Many MCC participants have no prior programming experience, and learning Python is perhaps the gentlest way to start programming. Once you know how to program in a certain language, the skill can be easily transferred to other languages.**Are the competition problems the same for all categories (Bongsu, Muda, Sulong)?**Yes. However, cutoff for award winners will differ by category.#### **LEARN PYTHON**
**How do I learn Python so that I can solve the challenging tasks?**Below is the list of recommended resources to learn Python, and also tools that might help with your learning:- Interactive Python tutorial[http://www.learnpython.org/](http://www.learnpython.org/)
- Online code editor and terminal for Python[http://repl.it/languages/Python](http://repl.it/languages/Python)

**I have no clue how to solve the [MCC 2014 demo problem](http://mcc2014.ioimalaysia.org/demo) - help!**Well, OK. We will be nice to help you get started. Here is the code (which you can copy &amp; paste into the provided code editor):<pre># beavers = [4, 3, 2, 1]# tunnels = ['black', 'white', 'black']for tunnel in tunnels:  if tunnel == 'black':    beavers = beavers[::-1]  if tunnel == 'white':    beavers[0], beavers[-1] = beavers[-1], beavers[0]print beavers</pre>
